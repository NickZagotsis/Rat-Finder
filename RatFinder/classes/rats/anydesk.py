    This class is responsible for parsing AnyDesk.

    This class is responsible for the parsing of anydesk, which includes every type of log parsing, description adding
    to each message, and session attribution.

    Attributes
    ----------
        ad_svc_trace_results : dict[int,list[dict[str, str]]]
            A dictionary containing parsed results from `ad_svc.trace` files.

            Each key in the dictionary represents a unique session identifier (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).
            The corresponding value is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single log entry (i.e., a row)
            with the following keys:

            - LogLevel: The severity level of the log message.
            - Timestamp: The timestamp of when the log entry was recorded.
            - Service: The name of the service associated with the log.
            - LogService: The specific log source or subcomponent.
            - Message: The raw log message content.
            - Explanation: A parsed or interpreted version of the message, if available.
            - File: The filename or path of the log file from which the entry was parsed.

        ad_trace_results : dict[int,list[dict[str, str]]]
            A dictionary containing parsed results from `ad.trace` files.

            Each key in the dictionary represents a unique session identifier (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).
            The corresponding value is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single log entry (i.e., a row)
            with the following keys:

            - LogLevel (str): The severity level of the log message.
            - Timestamp (str): The timestamp of when the log entry was recorded.
            - Service (str): The name of the service associated with the log.
            - LogService (str): The specific log source or subcomponent.
            - Message (str): The raw log message content.
            - Explanation (str): A parsed or interpreted version of the message, if available.
            - File (str): The filename or path of the log file from which the entry was parsed.


        connection_trace_results : List[str]
            Each entry in the list represents a parsed line from the `connection_trace.txt` file, fields are separated with `#`.

        shared : Shared
            Stored reference to the shared object passed in the constructor.

        ips : dict[str, list[str]]
            Dictionary to store detected IP addresses with the relative file(s) found.

        ips_timestamps : dict[str, list[str]]
            Dictionary to store detected IP addresses with the relative timestamps it was found.

        clients_timestamps : dict[str, list[str]]
            Client identifiers with corresponding timestamps.

        IP_REGEX : str
            Regular expression pattern to match IPv4 addresses.

        CLIENT_ID_REGEX : str
            Regular expression pattern to match 9â€“10 digit client IDs.

        logger : Logger
            `Logger` instance retrieved from the shared object.

        anydesk_keys : list[str]
            `List` of AnyDesk-related configuration keys used during parsing.

        attribution_ad_svc : dict[int, dict[str, list]]
            Tracks attribution results from service-level traces. The initial dictionary's keys
            refer to each session (1,2,3...) each of which have a dictionary of alias(es), ip(s), ID(s) found
            in the session. So it matches Session X with the respective information.

        attribution_ad_trace : dict[int, dict[str, list]]
            Tracks attribution results from general trace logs. The initial dictionary's keys
            refer to each session (1,2,3...) each of which have a dictionary of alias(es), ip(s), ID(s) found
            in the session. So it matches Session X with the respective information.

        anydesk_log_dict : dict[str,str]
            Dictionary of AnyDesk log line patterns and their descriptions,
            used for detecting and interpreting log events.

        patterns : list[str]
            List of regex/string patterns derived from the keys of `anydesk_log_dict`.

        ids_w_aliases : dict
            Mapping of detected client IDs to their corresponding aliases.

        files_uploaded : dict
            Dictionary to store uploaded files with the relative session(s) found.
            It contains the following structure:

            {"file_path": {session_id: {"sum_files": int,"files": {"RootFolder": int,}}}}

            files_downloaded : dict
            Dictionary to store downloaded files with the relative session(s) found.
            It contains the following structure:

            {"file_path": {session_id: {"sum_files": int}}}
    """

        """
        Initialize the log parser with shared resources and prepare internal structures.

        Parameters
